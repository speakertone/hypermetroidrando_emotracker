# Hyper Metroid Randomizer Map Tracker Pack

A map and item tracker for the Hyper Metroid Item Randomizer by [Galamoz](https://github.com/Galamoz).
This pack must be used with [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net).

## Notes

- **Includes full autotracking capabilities.** Due to the way the randomizer works, however, there will always be one random location that is not tracked properly. I don't know how to solve this, but it shouldn't be much of an issue anyway.
- **Works for both Casual and Veteran difficulty.** If playing a Casual seed, you may simply ignore any sequence break (yellow) markers.
- Any locations that require you to Infinite Bomb Jump, Hellrun, or do Suitless Maridia are marked as sequence breaks (yellow)

## Credits

 - [DorkmasterFlek](https://github.com/DorkmasterFlek) - Created the Super Metroid DASH randomizer tracker, which I completely based this pack upon. Their autotracker was especially helpful, as I was able to adapt it to work with Hyper Metroid.
 - [SauceRelic](https://github.com/SauceRelic) - Created the tracker that DorkmasterFlek based *their* tracker on, which means they also likely helped me out quite a bit.
